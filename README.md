# Singly Linked List Practice

This document demonstrates how to implement a singly linked list in JavaScript, including common operations.

## Node Structure

A node typically contains a value and a reference to the next node.

## Linked List Class

The linked list class manages the nodes and provides methods for:

- Adding a node at the start of the list
- Adding a node at the end of the list
- Finding the index of a value in the list
- Displaying the list contents
- Removing a node by value
- Removing a node by index
- Reversing the list
- Checking if the list is empty
- Getting the length of the list
- Inserting a node at a specific index

Practice implementing these methods to strengthen your understanding!
